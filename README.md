# Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
## The purpose of the analysis is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. 
In our analysis we created Tableau visualizations to show the following metrics:
- Length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- Number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
# Results: We presented the following visualizations in our Tableau story.

## The majority of trip lengths are around 5 minutes.

## Trips continue to be lower, less than 30 minutes regardless of gender.

## Peak trip hours mimic commuting hours on weekdays and daylight hours on weekends.

## Peak trip hours are consistent across all genders, males have a higher volume over all though.

## Both male and females have a higher instance of being subscribers rather than customers. Unknown gender has a higher instance of being customers rather than subscribers. 

# Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations that you would perform with the given dataset.
Over all we saw correlations consistent with time of day when bikes are rented out. When filtering results for gender we did not see a variation except that males have a higher volume over all of renting out bikes. We also included 2 visualizations we created during the module - bike rental trip length vs bike ID and bike repairs vs bike ID. In general trips are longer with the higher bike IDs. If we assume the higher ID number correlates to a bike added to the inventory more recently this makes sense as there may have been a limit on trip time earlier in the company's history or perhaps that the bikes added later are better quality. Also, if a bike is being used for longer trips then that also correlates to the number of repairs and service it will need.
